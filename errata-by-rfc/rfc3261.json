So even if the given examples are theoretically possible for a conforming implementation, they seem rather misleading.\r\n\r\nFor a \"typical\" 32 bit random value, even with base74 encoding, the shortest tag value would require six characters. Given that all three examples (which are also repeated almost unchanged in section 20.20) contain no uppercase ALPHA characters in the tag values, the implied encoding is more likely something like base32 or base36, which would require at least seven characters to represent a typical 32 bit random value.
