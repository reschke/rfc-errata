    "notes": "Rationale:\r\n\r\nAs explained in Section 1 od BCP 13, RFC 4288, the concept of a\r\n\"Media Type\" formalized for the first time in the MIME RFCs has gained\r\nsignificance far beyond the narrow area of Internet Mail. Therefore,\r\nthe related terms should not be used in the colloquial form including\r\n\"MIME\" that did not even appear in RFC 2045; in particular, the\r\ncolloquial term \"MIME Type\" (or \"MIME Media Type\") should generally\r\nbe avoided in favor of the (original and) more appropriate bare\r\n\"Media Type\".\r\n\r\nI'd expect that a Full Standard RFC follows the established\r\nterminology of the IETF, and that it uses the revised Media Type\r\nregistration boilerplate published in RFC 4288 (December 2005),\r\neven when it merely updates/re-parents an existing registration.\r\n\r\nEPP has not even a standardized transport binding to Internet Email.\r\nHence, tying the terminology to MIME seems even more inappropriate\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nAlexey Melnikov: I can't see anybody be confused by use of MIME type where use of \"media type\" would be slightly more appropriate.",
