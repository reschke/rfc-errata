It could be read in a number of ways, of which only one can be correct:\r\n\r\n1. The label is valid in terms of syntax (e.g. not Implicit NULL), but no binding has been installed because the label hasn't been advertised. Clearly, 3.18 covers this case already, and is inconsistent with the section title of \"Lack of Outgoing Label\" so this interpretation is unlikely to have been intended.\r\n\r\n2. The label is valid and is expected to be used for forwarding, but an NHLFE entry is missing or not usable because the interface the next hop is reachable over has gone down, or for some other reason isn't usable. This interpretation is ruled out by the statement that \"it is tempting in such cases to strip off the label stack and attempt to forward the packet further via conventional forwarding\", which wouldn't be possible if the interface was down.\r\n\r\n3. A resource allocation error occurred meaning that the ILM binding was allocated, but the NHLFE entry couldn't be allocated. There is no mention of resource issues in this or related sections so again this interpretation seems unlikely.\r\n\r\n4. The label is valid and is expected to be used for forwarding, but the LSR has received no label binding from the LSP's next hop even though it has a usable L3 next hop  (i.e. it lacks an outgoing label). It cannot map to an NHLFE entry because the actions in section 3.10 don't include popping and forwarding as unlabeled. This is therefore the interpretation that best fits.\r\n\r\nTo clarify that interpretation 4 is the one intended, the phrase \"and it has a usable L3 next hop\" is inserted into the text, using the definition of L3 next hop from section 3.17.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \n   Although the reporter is concerned about ambiguity in terms of why the ILM doesn't map a valid label into an NHLFE, the reason that might happen is really irrelevant. The original statement clearly specifies that it could be an error or transient condition.\r\n\r\nThe correct action of discarding a packet where the label doesn't map into a n NHLFE applies regardless of whether or not there is a usable L3 next hop.\r\nThis proposed errata would thus add incorrect ambiguity for no purpose.",

    "notes": "My rational for highlighting (no pun intended) these problems is that the overloading of the L2, L3 abbreviations layer 2 and layer 3, with the names L1, L2, L3 and L for labels, plus the use of L1 and L2 as indexed names for the ordinal position of a label prefixed to a payload, then to use L2 and L3 as to actually mean layer 2 and layer is uh ... sloppy. \r\n\r\n\r\nHonestly, I can't understand how RFC 3031 has been posted for twenty years and that it is on the Standards Track and no one has found these problems. \r\n\r\nIts similar to when someone publishes a mathematical treatise and use the same set of variable names {x, y, z, t} over and over again in different contexts spread throughout the paper. Its intractable and practically gibberish. \r\n\r\nI apologize if my criticism is harsh regarding this problem but I spent a considerable amount of my time reading this document trying to make sense of it before I realized that the fault is not mine but it is of the document.\r\n\r\n[Andrew] This seems to wide and generalized to be a simple errata, as such I am marking this as held for document update.",
