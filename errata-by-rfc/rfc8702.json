    "notes": "The originally described 0xD2B282C2 is the hex value of the binary representation (LSB first) of the string \"KMAC\" as defined in SP800-185. As it was pointed out to us, that representation was confusing and incorrect because NIST's KAT values include \"KMAC\" in hex format. Showing \"KMAC\" in binary (LSB first) is different than showing it in hex (MSB first). So, it is more accurate to keep the text generic as \"KMAC\" and point implementers to SP800-185.",
