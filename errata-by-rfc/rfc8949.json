    "notes": "The rest of the text implies that a map key is a simple data item such as integer, string, byte string, etc.  However, there is no explicit statement to this effect.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear how a map would behave if the key was itself a map.\r\n\r\nIt could be useful to allow arrays as map keys, e.g. for tag 4 (decimal fraction).  It seems relatively clear how to create a map key from integers.  However for other complex structures such as tag 40 (multi-dimensional array), it's not clear how you would use that as a map key.",
