The processing rules\r\nalso specified by this RFC require that the value of the Author: field when created MUST BE identical\r\nthe the value of the From: field.  This condition cannot be satisfied in general, because the From: \r\nfield (per RFC 6854) admits values that the Author: field does not admit.\r\n\r\nThis RFC should be updated to follow the RFC 6854 syntax and include RFC 6854 in the normative references.",
