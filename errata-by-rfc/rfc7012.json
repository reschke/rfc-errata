    "notes": "Although section 1.1 says : - \"Definitions of timestamp data types have been clarified.\" The edited text has removed the epoch definition, and this does not seem to have been incorporated elsewhere in the RFC. \r\n\r\nWithout a specified epoch, there is no unique definition of the timestamps. \r\n\r\nMy proposal above is to revert to the RFC5102 definitions. RFC7102 is intended to be backwards compatible with RFC5102 and thus the definitions need to be technically identical. Alternatively, if the text is now included elsewhere in RFC7012 or in another RFC, it would be helpful to the reader to provide a reference to the epoch definition in an editorial update to dateTimeX definitions in RFC7102.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nReject reason: issue addressed in errata 3881",
