    "notes": "First, thank you to all the IETF contributors who do such amazing work to keep the Internet going (seriously!). I noticed this minor omission while implementing the specification. I spoke with Mr. Mirsky (one of the authors) who suggested I file this report. Of course, the authors' intent is not in doubt, but he suggested that I submit this report nonetheless. Besides this very minor misstatement, as someone writing an implementation who was completely uninvolved in drafting the RFC, I have found this document to be incredibly readable and easy to follow -- thank you!\r\n\r\n[Edit: WK (Ops AD): Thanks for the Errata (and the kind note) ].",
