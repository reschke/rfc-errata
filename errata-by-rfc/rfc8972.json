    "notes": "First, thank you to all the IETF contributors who do such amazing work to keep the Internet going (seriously!). I noticed this minor omission while implementing the specification. I spoke with Mr. Mirsky (one of the authors) who suggested I file this report. Of course, the authors' intent is not in doubt, but he suggested that I submit this report nonetheless. Besides this very minor misstatement, as someone writing an implementation who was completely uninvolved in drafting the RFC, I have found this document to be incredibly readable and easy to follow -- thank you!\r\n\r\n[Edit: WK (Ops AD): Thanks for the Errata (and the kind note) ].",

I hope that what I have included makes it obvious what needs to be changed.\r\n\r\nI have conferred with one of the RFC's authors who indicated that the inclusion of T2 and T3 were simply the result of an error in drafting. We collaborated via email to arrive at the corrected text I have submitted here. I say that only to indicate that I have attempted to do enough research prior to submitting this report so that it is not a waste of time but _not_ to imply that the person with whom I communicated endorses this report.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your work!\r\nWill",

The sentence at the beginning of section 4.7 is meant to refer to the Timestamp field in the STAMP packet transmitted by the Session Reflector.\r\n\r\nThe earlier draft of this RFC specified that what is currently named the Follow-Up Timestamp field should be named the Timestamp field. The name collision resulted in an overzealous search/replace hiccup. I hope that having the record reflect the correct field name will save future developers from having to scratch their head like I did.\r\n\r\nAs usual, I sincerely appreciate the technical accuracy of the authors of the STAMP-related RFCs.
