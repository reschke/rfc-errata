Because domain ownership\r\nmay change hands over time, implementations MUST NOT resolve the\r\nURI for any purpose. Resolution is purely for human documentation\r\nconsiderations, and even then, caution is advised when readers\r\nclick on URIs shown in this specification, as underlying domains\r\nhave changed hands since its original publication.",
    "notes": "(Reported on behalf of Alfonso Alongi <alfonso.alongi.it@gmail.com>. \r\n\r\nThese URLs are no longer valid and now redirect to a casino sponsorship website. This change in ownership renders these references irrelevant and misleading for implementations relying on this RFC.\r\n\r\nUse of Non-Secure HTTP Scheme:\r\nThe URLs use the http:// scheme instead of https://, which does not guarantee transport-layer security. This poses risks, especially in contexts where trust and integrity are critical.\r\n\r\nRelevance of Hardcoding References:\r\nThe functionality described in RFC 8409 (Entity Category Attribute and Entity Category Support Attribute) can be implemented using SAML's existing support for custom attributes, without reliance on these specific URLs.",
