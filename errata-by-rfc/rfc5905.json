    "notes": "The majority of the rows in Figure 1 are correct if the 'Packet Mode Value' refers to the mode of packets which are expected to be received by an NTP speaker which has mobilized an association with the corresponding 'Association Mode'.  Assuming this is the case, the last two rows are incorrect:\r\n\r\n* A peer with a mobilized 'Broadcast Server' mode association is not expected to receive any packets at all for this association -- a broadcast server does not receive anything back (see 'Broadcast' mode row in Section 9.2, Figure 20, where each column in that row is 'DSCRD'.)  Therefore, the value of 'Packet Mode Value' for 'Broadcast Server' should be 'N/A', not '5'.\r\n\r\n* A peer with a mobilized 'Broadcast Client' mode association is expected to receive packets with a 'Packet Mode Value' of 5 for this association (see 'Bcast Client' mode row in Section 9.2, Figure 20, where each column in that row is 'DSCRD' except for the '5' column, which is 'PROC'.)  Therefore, the value of 'Packet Mode Value' for 'Broadcast Client' should be '5', not 'N/A'.\r\n\r\nIt might help the clarity of Figure 1 if the row labeled 'Packet Mode Value' were to be changed to 'Receive Packet Mode Value(s)'.\r\n\r\nThe text immediately following Figure 1 also has the packet mode values swapped.  As made clear throughout the RFC (for example, see Section 9.2 where is says, \"FXMIT.  This indicates a client (mode 3) packet matching no association (mode 0).  If the destination address is not a broadcast address, the server constructs a server (mode 4) packet and returns it to the client without retaining state.\"), clients send servers packet mode 3 packets, not packet mode 4 packets; it is servers which send clients packet mode 4 packets, not packet mode 3 packets.\r\n\r\nJust to make it perfectly clear, here are the modes of packets sent:\r\n\r\n* Time t0: client mobilizes 'Client' mode association for server (via configuration, or due to reception of manycast server packet)\r\n* Time t1: client transmits mode 3 packet to server (e.g. via poll(p) => peer_xmit(p) when c.t >= p->nextdate)\r\n* Time t2: server receives mode 3 packet from client (dispatch: FXMIT; no association found or mobilized)\r\n* Time t3: server transmits mode 4 packet to client\r\n* Time t4: client receives mode 4 packet from server (matches previously mobilized association -- dispatch: PROC)",

    "notes": "In addition to the correction proposed in Errata ID 5601, I think that the formula to calculate the dispersion should be revised. The term \"p.psi\" should be multiplied by not one, but a larger value.\r\n\r\nThis is because the dispersion is defined as the statistics that represent the maximum error, so when it is calculated, it should take into account the maximum errors in the offset estimation. However, the jitter p.psi is defined as the RMS average of the offset values theta_j relative to theta_0, so the term \"p.psi\" does not represent the maximum error caused by the distribution of the offset values.\r\n\r\nIf we assume that the offset value follows the uniform distribution, the error bound is represented as sqrt(3) * p.psi. So, at least, the term \"p.psi\" should be multiplied by sqrt(3). There is arbitrarity in choice of the distribution type, so depending on the distribution type the factor may change. For example, if the normal distribution is assumed, 5 * p.psi gives us 99.99994% confidence. Assuming that the system variable is updated every 16 seconds, the actual offset may be outside the range [theta_0 - 5 * p.psi, theta_0 + 5 * p.psi] approximately once a year. It should be sufficient for usual Internet applications, though someone may think that the factor \"5\" may not be sufficient depending on the application.",
