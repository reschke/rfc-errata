Each one will attempt to connect in serial, and take tens of seconds to time out.\r\n\r\nIf the user then attempts to use an application which legitimately uses a WebSocket to \"wss://google.com:443/\", then due to the throttling to google.com it will not be able to connect until all of the attacker's connections have timed out.\r\n\r\nThe user will perceive that the legitimate application is malfunctioning, since there is no visible sign that they are being attacked. From the server end, the attack is only apparent in the firewall logs. The actual rate of SYN packets dropped will be small and unlikely to trigger an alert.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, with the (host,port) interpretation, connections to google.com:81 do not block connections to google.com:443, and this attack is completely ineffective.\r\n\r\n=== Verifier Notes ===\r\n\r\nThe subsequent paragraph already indicates what must be done in the case where the IP address cannot be determined, so this change should not create any difficulties in the case where the connection is tunnelled via an HTTP(S) or SOCKS5 proxy.\r\n\r\nA separate concern has been raised that this section creates problems for WebSocket proxies and non-browser clients.

    "orig_text": "5.4.  Fragmentation\r\n\r\n   The primary purpose of fragmentation is to allow sending a message\r\n   that is of unknown size when the message is started without having to\r\n   buffer that message.  If messages couldn't be fragmented, then an\r\n   endpoint would have to buffer the entire message so its length could\r\n   be counted before the first byte is sent.  With fragmentation, a\r\n   server or intermediary may choose a reasonable size buffer and, when\r\n   the buffer is full, write a fragment to the network.\r\n\r\n   A secondary use-case for fragmentation is for multiplexing, where it\r\n   is not desirable for a large message on one logical channel to\r\n   monopolize the output channel, so the multiplexing needs to be free\r\n   to split the message into smaller fragments to better share the\r\n   output channel.  (Note that the multiplexing extension is not\r\n   described in this document.)\r\n\r\n   Unless specified otherwise by an extension, frames have no semantic\r\n   meaning.  An intermediary might coalesce and/or split frames, if no\r\n   extensions were negotiated by the client and the server or if some\r\n   extensions were negotiated, but the intermediary understood all the\r\n   extensions negotiated and knows how to coalesce and/or split frames\r\n   in the presence of these extensions.  One implication of this is that\r\n   in absence of extensions, senders and receivers must not depend on\r\n   the presence of specific frame boundaries.\r\n\r\n   The following rules apply to fragmentation:\r\n\r\n   o  An unfragmented message consists of a single frame with the FIN\r\n      bit set (Section 5.2) and an opcode other than 0.\r\n\r\n   o  A fragmented message consists of a single frame with the FIN bit\r\n      clear and an opcode other than 0, followed by zero or more frames\r\n      with the FIN bit clear and the opcode set to 0, and terminated by\r\n      a single frame with the FIN bit set and an opcode of 0.  A\r\n      fragmented message is conceptually equivalent to a single larger\r\n      message whose payload is equal to the concatenation of the\r\n      payloads of the fragments in order; however, in the presence of\r\n      extensions, this may not hold true as the extension defines the\r\n      interpretation of the \"Extension data\" present.  For instance,\r\n      \"Extension data\" may only be present at the beginning of the first\r\n      fragment and apply to subsequent fragments, or there may be\r\n      \"Extension data\" present in each of the fragments that applies\r\n      only to that particular fragment.  In the absence of \"Extension\r\n      data\", the following example demonstrates how fragmentation works.\r\n\r\n      EXAMPLE: For a text message sent as three fragments, the first\r\n      fragment would have an opcode of 0x1 and a FIN bit clear, the\r\n      second fragment would have an opcode of 0x0 and a FIN bit clear,\r\n      and the third fragment would have an opcode of 0x0 and a FIN bit\r\n      that is set.\r\n\r\n   o  Control frames (see Section 5.5) MAY be injected in the middle of\r\n      a fragmented message.  Control frames themselves MUST NOT be\r\n      fragmented.\r\n\r\n   o  Message fragments MUST be delivered to the recipient in the order\r\n      sent by the sender.\r\n\r\n   o  The fragments of one message MUST NOT be interleaved between the\r\n      fragments of another message unless an extension has been\r\n      negotiated that can interpret the interleaving.\r\n\r\n   o  An endpoint MUST be capable of handling control frames in the\r\n      middle of a fragmented message.\r\n\r\n   o  A sender MAY create fragments of any size for non-control\r\n      messages.\r\n\r\n   o  Clients and servers MUST support receiving both fragmented and\r\n      unfragmented messages.\r\n\r\n   o  As control frames cannot be fragmented, an intermediary MUST NOT\r\n      attempt to change the fragmentation of a control frame.\r\n\r\n   o  An intermediary MUST NOT change the fragmentation of a message if\r\n      any reserved bit values are used and the meaning of these values\r\n      is not known to the intermediary.\r\n\r\n   o  An intermediary MUST NOT change the fragmentation of any message\r\n      in the context of a connection where extensions have been\r\n      negotiated and the intermediary is not aware of the semantics of\r\n      the negotiated extensions.  Similarly, an intermediary that didn't\r\n      see the WebSocket handshake (and wasn't notified about its\r\n      content) that resulted in a WebSocket connection MUST NOT change\r\n      the fragmentation of any message of such connection.\r\n\r\n   o  As a consequence of these rules, all fragments of a message are of\r\n      the same type, as set by the first fragment's opcode.  Since\r\n      control frames cannot be fragmented, the type for all fragments in\r\n      a message MUST be either text, binary, or one of the reserved\r\n      opcodes.\r\n\r\n   NOTE: If control frames could not be interjected, the latency of a\r\n   ping, for example, would be very long if behind a large message.\r\n   Hence, the requirement of handling control frames in the middle of a\r\n   fragmented message.\r\n\r\n   IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: In the absence of any extension, a receiver\r\n   doesn't have to buffer the whole frame in order to process it.  For\r\n   example, if a streaming API is used, a part of a frame can be\r\n   delivered to the application.  However, note that this assumption\r\n   might not hold true for all future WebSocket extensions.\r\n",

    "notes": "There is no indication or mention of the payload length of the frame with regards to fragmentation. In abstract, it's apparent that the payload length specified in the header of the frame corresponds to the actual frames payload length. However, implementations have been observed that allow the headers payload length to be specified as a higher length than the actual raw payload of that frame. In the event that this occurs, some implementations are reallocating memory to support the length of what is reported as the entire payload of all fragmented messages combined, and continue building the buffer off of each frame from that point forward by allocating enough memory for specified payload length. Obviously, this opens up the potential for a memory consumption DoS attack on an implementation that uses this method. A lack of specification with regards to the RFC allows for such a mistake to happen, as it is not clearly defined in the fragmentation section.\r\n\r\nThe RFC specifies that fragmented messages should be used to send messages of an unknown length, i.e. streaming media, and therefore should also specify that the frame length bit should be preserved to the length of only that current frame and not be used to specify the overall payload length of all fragmented messages combined. Implementations should be forced to work with them on a frame-by-frame basis and to drop the connection of any instances where the specified length of the frames payload does not match the length of the actual raw payload data for that one frame.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nThanks, Jonathan, for some useful comments.

    "notes": "For any other opcode defined frames are explicitly listed and described in either Section 5.5 or Section 5.6. But continuation frame is not. \r\n\r\nFormally it matches definition of data frame (given in section 5.6) as the most significant bit of its opcode is 0. Logically it should be data frame too. But it is unclear whether there are two categories of frames (data and control) or the Continuation frame represents the third.\r\n\r\nOne could guess though that Continuation frame is a data frame from the content of the section 5.5.1 stating that \"An endpoint MAY delay sending a Close frame until its current message is sent (for instance, if the majority of a fragmented message is already sent, an endpoint MAY send the remaining fragments before sending a Close frame)\". This fragment clarifies that Close frame is sent after an endpoint finished message transmission. Thus such interpreation would be consistent with the Section 5.5.1 stating that \"The application MUST NOT send any more data frames after sending a Close frame\".",
