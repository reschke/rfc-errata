    "notes": "This even case can happen only when fn == sn > 0, which means that the shifting loop always terminates with fn odd (and hence non-zero).\r\n\r\nSuggesting that fn == 0 can happen is confusing, since in this case the preceding update of r, using a path element as *left* sibling, makes no sense. Not sure if it would be helpful to also add a comment explaining why the loop terminates.\r\n\r\nThe same correction applies to 2.1.4.2, algorithm step 6.b.iii.",
