    "notes": "The section 4.2.2 specifies header size constraints and notes that implementations can send a SETTINGS frame with a SETTINGS_MAX_FIELD_SECTION_SIZE identifier to set a limit on the maximum size of the message header. Since this a maximum size, the sentence that states that intermediaries aren't guaranteed to accept a message below this limit seems odd and I think it should instead say \"above this limit\".\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nThe current RFC text is correct. The problem that is being described is where 1) a client sends a message smaller than MAX_FIELD_SECTION_SIZE and might expect that to work but 2) the server is an intermediary that needs to forward the message onto another server that, for example,  has a smaller value for MAX_FIELD_SECTION_SIZE preventing this.\r\n\r\nAny further clarification to this text, if any is needed, should be made via an update to this document.
