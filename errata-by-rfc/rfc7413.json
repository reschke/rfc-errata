    "notes": "The original language seems to imply that the cached negative response should only affect connections if they are initiated from the same source port and source IP.\r\n\r\nSince the client source port can change for subsequent TCP connections, and it's unlikely that just changing the source port would result in a successful TCP FO connection when a previous connection from a different source port failed, associating the cached negative response with the source port is probably not very useful, and could actually be detrimental to performance and reliability, depending on the implementation.\r\n\r\nIf the implementation would decide to check the source port when matching negative cached responses to a new connection, it would negatively impact performance when the source port changes, because the implementation wouldn't find a matching negative response in the cache.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if each connection retry is made from a different source port, checking the source port when matching the cached negative responses would make the client unable to connect to the server, until all possible source ports are included in cached negative responses.\r\n\r\nThis means it's much better not recommending to associate the source port to the cached negative responses, to prevent any confusion and possible implementation issues.\r\n\r\nEither that, or add additional clarification, describing exactly how a negative cached response should be matched to a subsequent connection attempt.",
