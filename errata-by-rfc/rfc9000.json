Such tokens, even if they appear to be Retry tokens, are supposed to be handled by the requirements in 8.1.3, i.e. ignore the token and handle the packet as if no token were present.\r\n\r\nThis section should be scoped only to tokens which are correctly formatted and readable by the server, but whose contents are not sufficient to prove the client's transport address is valid. Otherwise, the determination that the token is a Retry token cannot be trusted.\r\n\r\n(This discrepancy appears in a multi-CDN context, where tokens generated by one CDN will sometimes be received by a different CDN; if these tokens appear to be \"invalid Retry tokens\", the connection is closed when the token should simply be ignored.)",
