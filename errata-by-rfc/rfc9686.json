    "notes": "Replace 1% tolerance with 3s tolerance.\r\n\r\nRationale: As the remaining lifetime approaches zero, the 1% tolerance also approaches zero which can trigger redundant address refreshes. This problem is exacerbated by potential integer rounding, where 1% of 99s could be rounded down to 0s.\r\nAndroid's implementation of this mechanism uses a 3s tolerance instead. Since both clock skew and transmission delays are independent from the address lifetime, using a static tolerance is more consistent and still follows the original intent of this mechanism.\r\n\r\n--- Verifier note (Eric Vyncke) ---\r\nSee the thread at https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dhcwg/j1XxAx2yNlmq_EA2M0Uc_pjIxMA/",
