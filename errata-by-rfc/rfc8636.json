Versions of draft-ietf-krb-wg-pkinit-alg-agility through -04, inclusive, had a field in the OtherInfo type called 'ticket', and this is why the test vectors in section 8 still refer to 'ticket': it used to be an input to the KDF in an old version of the draft, but later it was dropped.  When the 'ticket' field of the OtherInfo type was dropped an oversight caused the 'ticket' input in section 8 not to also be dropped.",

    "notes": "The negotiation of KDF in PKINIT as of RFC 8636 uses an exchange of OBJECT IDENTIFIER values, not AlgorithmIdentifier values, but when a value of the OtherInfo type is created and serialized we need to know what parameters to use for the algorithmID member of the OtherInfo value, and this is not specified anywhere.\r\n\r\nElsewhere in RFC 8636 we see this text:\r\n\r\n   The KDFAlgorithmId structure contains an object identifier that\r\n   identifies a KDF.  The algorithm of the KDF and its parameters are\r\n   defined by the corresponding specification of that KDF.\r\n\r\nbut the KDFs are all specified in RFC 8636 itself and no parameters are specified for the KDFs.  There is an reference to NIST.SP.800-56Ar3 in section 6 of RFC 8636:\r\n\r\n   The KDF algorithm described in this document (based on [SP80056A])\r\n   can be implemented using any cryptographic hash function.\r\n\r\nbut NIST.SP.800-56Ar3 does not specify parameters to the KDFs either.\r\n\r\nThe question then is: what shall the parameters be set to in the OtherInfo algorithmID identifying the KDF?  There are two options: exclude the parameters member (it is OPTIONAL after all), or include it with the DER encoding of NULL (common for some algorithms)?\r\n\r\nLooking at MIT Kerberos I believe the parameters member is left absent, therefore that is what implementators should do.",

    "notes": "The Kerberos random2key function (see RFCs 3961 and 3962) is the identity function for the AES enctypes, but for 3DES it is not.  The \"key-material\" output is supposed to the output of the KDF prior to application of the Kerberos random2key function.  The third test vector in section 8 (\"Test Vector for SHA-512, enctype 16\"), the one in section 8.4, is for the 3DES enctype because enctype 16 is the KRB5_ENCTYPE_DES3_CBC_SHA1 enctype (see RFCs 4120 and 3961), and as you can see the expected key length is 24 bytes (as expected for a 3DES-based enctype).\r\n\r\nTherefore the \"key-material\" output in section 8.4.2 can be expected to differ from the \"key\" output.  And in my (work in progress) code in Heimdal for implementing RFC 8636 so it is.  The key-material in the corrected text is the correct key material, though I should also check this in MIT Kerberos.",
