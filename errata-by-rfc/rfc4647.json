    "notes": "The original text illustrated above states that the 'lookup' matching scheme operates using 'basic language ranges' as opposed to 'extended language ranges'. However, the description of the 'lookup' matching scheme in section 3.4, in its last two paragraphs (beginning with \"In some cases,\"), describes how extended language ranges are processed by the 'lookup' matching scheme. Thus, section 3.1 indicates that 'extended language ranges' are not supported by the 'lookup' matching scheme, while section 3.4 indicates the opposite and describes how they are to be supported.\r\n\r\nThis contradiction can lead to confusion for the reader and compliance ambiguity for the implementor.",
