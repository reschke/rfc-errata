    "notes": "[I was notified, that errata report 1766 and 1908 has been verified, but apparently, report 1905 was left undecided.  I am a bit concerned, because this report points to a true defect of RFC 5322, so, maybe, a clearer reasoning helps.  This report is meant to replace my former posting 1905.]\r\n\r\nThe <obs-unstruct> rule covers field bodies of unstructured fields (as declared in section 2.2.1), that conform to obsoleted RFC 2822 or RFC 822.  It is only to be used for downward compatibility when reading messages.  It corresponds to <text> in RFC 822 and <obs-utext> in RFC 2822.  In a conforming message, an unstructured field body is always followed by a field delimiting non-folding CRLF.\r\n\r\n<obs-unstruct> is equivalent to *(d0-d127), so the CRLF delimiting the field is made part of the field body, as is the rest of the header section.\r\n\r\nSo my proposal refines the rule: Use any, possibly empty, sequence of ASCII characters, as long as it does not contain a CRLF outside of a folding white space.\r\n\r\nThere is a nuisance left: when applied possessively, the CR of the adjacent field delimiter CRLF is consumed as well.  This cannot be overcome, no matter how you rewrite the rule, because the ABNF in RFC 5324 is not rich enough to express something like \"consume all but one CR\".  A higher level construct like \"obs-unstruct CRLF\" must enforce a back-tracking step on the part of <obs-unstruct> in order to match.  That is why I added the comment.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nDuplicate of erratum 1905, which I believe is correct as stated.   ",

    "notes": "The choice of \"US-ASCII\" as a charset name reflected circumstances at the time, but it was not then and has never been the name of a coded character set, much less the one specified in the various versions of what is now ANSI INCITS 4-1986[R2017].  The common name of the latter, both specified in the Standard and in common practice, is \"ASCII\" without any further qualification.   \"For brevity\", \"ASCII\" is not only more accurate, but shorter.   While the correction is being made, it would be wise to change the citation anchor to \"[ASCII]\" or, if necessary for some reason, \"[ASCII1986]\".  The odd punctuation used in \"[ANSI.X3-4.1986]\" to refer to ANSI X3.4-1986 is just unnecessarily confusing.\r\n\r\n(this erratum is being reported more or less at the request of the editor of RFC 5322 and its successor)",

One could infer from the original form that the range is interpreted according to something in the standard, but that standard, unlike, e.g., Unicode, never uses a linear sequence of numbers to refer to code points, only the Column/Row notation shown above (plus, of course, the actual seven-bit binary coding).",
