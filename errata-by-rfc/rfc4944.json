    "notes": "The (non-ESCaped) Dispatch value is a 6-bit selector. However, it used to be a 7-bit selector, which has a value at most 127. When the field became a 6-bit selector, this maximum became 63, but the referring text was never updated. \r\n\r\nFor historical reference, see an early version from IETF 67 proposing the Dispatch value within the Dispatch header as a 7-bit field:\r\n\r\nhttp://6lowpan.tzi.org/FrontPage?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=tentative-draft2-ietf-6lowpan-format-07.txt\r\n\r\n   The dispatch type is defined by a zero-bit as the first bit.  The\r\n   dispatch type and header is shown here:\r\n\r\n                        1                   2                   3\r\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\r\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n   |0|  Dispatch   |  type-specific header\r\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n\r\n\r\n   Dispatch               7-bit selector.
