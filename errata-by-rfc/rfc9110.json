Upon receipt of a message with an invalid Content-Length value, senders MUST NOT forward the message with the invalid value intact.\r\n\r\nMark Nottingham confirmed on GitHub that the intended meaning is option 2:\r\nhttps://github.com/httpwg/http-core/issues/1113#issuecomment-1937914210\r\n\r\nI propose that the word \"forward\" be changed to \"send\" to clear up the ambiguity.\r\n\r\nIssue #2\r\nWe've just established that the intended meaning of the first half of the sentence in question is that malformed CL header values MUST NOT be forwarded intact.\r\nAn exception to this rule is (by definition) a situation in which invalid CL header values *are* permitted to be forwarded intact.\r\nThe \"exception\" described in the text does not allow for invalid header values to be forwarded intact, so it is a misuse of the word \"exception.\"\r\n\r\nTo clear this up, I propose that the sentence be split in two, and that the word \"exception\" be removed.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nIssue #1: 'forward' and 'send' are defined terms in the specification, and the previous paragraph covers the 'send' -- this requirement is specific to forwarding. It's specifically there to call out the exception _only_ in the forwarding case.\r\n\r\nFor issue #2, this might be more than an editorial problem, but mostly I disagree about \"exception\" being a misuse. I agree that more extensive editorial work could be done, but that is out of scope for an erratum.\r\n\r\nSee https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/httpbisa/wYhoNFePlmmj5g58g_70er8pTH4/",
