(Classification of routers) says:\r\n\r\n        AS boundary routers\r\n            A router that exchanges routing information with routers\r\n            belonging to other Autonomous Systems.  Such a router\r\n            advertises AS external routing information throughout the\r\n            Autonomous System.  The paths to each AS boundary router are\r\n            known by every router in the AS.  This classification is\r\n            completely independent of the previous classifications: AS\r\n            boundary routers may be internal or area border routers, and\r\n            may or may not participate in the backbone.\r\n\r\n*. Section 10.6 (Receiving Database Description Packets) says:\r\n\r\n\t      When the router accepts a received Database Description Packet\r\n        as the next in sequence the packet contents are processed as\r\n        follows.  For each LSA listed, the LSA's LS type is checked for\r\n        validity.  If the LS type is unknown (e.g., not one of the LS\r\n        types 1-5 defined by this specification), or if this is an AS-\r\n        external-LSA (LS type = 5) and the neighbor is associated with a\r\n        stub area, generate the neighbor event SeqNumberMismatch and\r\n        stop processing the packet.\r\n\r\n*.
