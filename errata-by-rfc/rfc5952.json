    "notes": "Historically from the 1960's, hexidecimal digits other than decimal digits are represented by upper case letters.  Lower case letters may have become acceptable as user input, but such resulted from lazy programmers who couldn't manage to hit the shift key on their keyboards.  However, lower case is not acceptable for digit output.  Many early assemblers would not even accept lower case as valid input digits except where the radix base exceeded 36 (thus exhausting all upper case values).  This poor programming practice should not be allowed to be codified into any Internet standard.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n- Struble, George W., \"Assembler Language Programming:  The IBM System/360 and /370.\"  Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., 1969 and 1975 (Second Edition), Page 6.
