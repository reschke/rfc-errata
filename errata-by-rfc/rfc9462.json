    "notes": "Ordinary DNS zones generally return NXDOMAIN for names that have no data of any type and that are not empty non-terminals. The behavior described in 9462 where \"resolvers SHOULD respond to [...] queries of any type for any domain name under resolver.arpa with NODATA\" is a special kind of behavior that requires odd configuration to achieve (e.g. https://github.com/NLnetLabs/unbound/issues/1016#issuecomment-2630681753) or handled as a special case if implemented in code. I also noticed that at least one implementation ignores this SHOULD (e.g. \"dig x.y.z.resolver.arpa @8.8.8.8\" returns an NXDOMAIN response (not NODATA) while \"dig -t SVCB _dns.resolver.arpa @8.8.8.8\" returns a DDR response).\r\n\r\nI do not see a rationale in the document for this special requirement. I searched the ADD mailing list and came up with the following references that touch on this issue but do not seem to specifically address why a NODATA response is needed for domain names below resolver.arpa (other than _dns.resolver.arpa):\r\n\r\nhttps://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/add/wV4Q8xDLV_5ys6uHrjFD2jLSaVI/\r\nhttps://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/add/b59f7wQI-3s2K-5o9MTAEFBIY7Q/\r\nhttps://github.com/ietf-wg-add/draft-ietf-add-ddr/issues/58\r\nhttps://github.com/ietf-wg-add/draft-ietf-add-ddr/pull/61\r\n\r\nSo I suspect this is a drafting error and something like the corrected text suggested in this erratum was meant instead.\r\n\r\nThere is a similar reference to NODATA rather than NXDOMAIN in Section 4 in the case where no Designated Resolver exists which also requires special configuration or implementation to achieve. I suspect that that text should say NXDOMAIN rather than NODATA.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n--- verifier note ---\r\nAlso note that this is a SHOULD and not a MUST",
