    "notes": "RFC 2616, section 2.2, contained the following text:\r\n\r\nAll linear white space, including folding, has the same semantics as SP. A recipient MAY replace any linear white space with a single SP before interpreting the field value or forwarding the message downstream.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, RFC 2616 section 4.2 contained the following text:\r\nAny LWS that occurs between field-content MAY be replaced with a single SP before interpreting the field value or forwarding the message downstream.\r\n\r\nIn section A.2. Changes from RFC 2616, the document does not list any intended change for how space and tab are handled, but the current text does appear to constitute a change. I suspect the change is accidental due to rewording the document when line folding was made deprecated.\r\n\r\nNote that in RFC 2616, LWS is defined as follows:\r\nLWS            = [CRLF] 1*( SP | HT )\r\n\r\nIn particular, the leading CRLF was optional.\r\n\r\nThus, the wording in RFC 2616 covered two cases:\r\n1. LWS that includes line folding.\r\n2. LWS that does not include line folding.\r\n\r\nThe current text does cover how to handle case #1 - former LWS that began with a CRLF; later in section 3.2.4 it requires rejecting or replacing with SP. (The old \"MAY\" language has effectively become a \"MUST\" for the leading CRLF case.)\r\n\r\nHowever, the current text does not appear to address case #2 - former LWS that does not begin with a CRLF - in other words, SP and HTAB occurring between field-content. I suspect the intention is still that a recipient should treat such whitespace as insignificant, and may replace any sequence of SP and HTAB with a single SP before interpreting the field content, but I believe the text of the current RFC no longer provides this behavior.\r\n\r\n(I have not read all of the specifications in full, so please accept my apologies if I have misread or missed a relevant portion elsewhere.)",
