The only reason C would appear in its own resolution is if the resolution is just [C], in which case removing C yields the empty list.  The intent here is correct.  If D is non-blank, as this section presumes, then the resolution of C will be [D, D.unmerged_leaves..., stuff_outside_of_subtree_D].  So what this says is that P and D agree on the unmerged leaves under D.",
