There are also several things in dot-atom-text which are also not in <pchar> (\"#\", \"/\", \"?\", \"^\", \"`\", \"{\", \"|\", \"}\"), so leaving dot-atom-text in place would not address the concern of the reporter. RFC 6068's answer is to simply say that, ABNF notwithstanding, some of the characters will need to be percent-encoded:\r\n\r\n   1.  A number of characters that can appear in <addr-spec> MUST be\r\n       percent-encoded.  These are the characters that cannot appear in\r\n       a URI according to [STD66] as well as \"%\" (because it is used for\r\n       percent-encoding) and all the characters in gen-delims except \"@\"\r\n       and \":\" (i.e., \"/\", \"?\", \"#\", \"[\", and \"]\").  Of the characters\r\n       in sub-delims, at least the following also have to be percent-\r\n       encoded: \"&\", \";\", and \"=\".  Care has to be taken both when\r\n       encoding as well as when decoding to make sure these operations\r\n       are applied only once.\r\n\r\nNow, this may have been a bogus way to do it (because you've got an ABNF which then has to be re-encoded to agree with generic URI syntax), but it was clearly agreed to when this document was published. Something may be wrong here, but this is not appropriate for a simple erratum.   ",
