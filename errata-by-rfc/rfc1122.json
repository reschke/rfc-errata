It is being subtracted again upon calculating Eff.snd.MSS when MMS_S is smaller than sendMSS+20.  In other words, if IP options are in use, its size is subtracted twice.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \n   In Section 3.3.3, it says \"Note that <IP header size> in this equation will be 20, unless\r\n         the IP reserves space to insert IP options for its own purposes\r\n         in addition to any options inserted by the transport layer.\"\r\n\r\n4.2.2.6 defines IPoptionsize as \"IPoptionsize is the size of any IP options that TCP\r\n                 will pass to the IP layer with the current message.\"\r\n\r\nSo MMS_S incorporates IP options from the IP layer, but IPoptionsize counts options coming from TCP.
