Note that the value\r\n            of trailing bits is irrelevant.\r\n\r\nRFC 8955 doesn't quite address the \"trailing bits\" consideration.  Following the advice from RFC 4271, irrelevant would primarily impact ignoring the trailing bits for purposes of installing firewall rules generated from flowspec routes.  For the ordering procedures, comparing two equivalent prefixes that differ in trailing bits should result in them being considered equal.\r\n\r\nImplementations of flowspec that don't ignore trailing bits may treat routes with components that differ only in trailing bits for their source or destination prefixes as different flowspec routes.\r\n\r\nFor updates to RFC 8955, including the upcoming flowspec v2, more normative text to zero out the trailing bits should be considered.",
