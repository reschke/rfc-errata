One might figure out that one is supposed to go to the actual TLP page (currently https://trustee.ietf.org/documents/IETF-TLP-5_001.html), but, while that page mentions \"legend(s)\" several times, one of those places is not in Section 6, which is described as \"Text To Be Included...\" and not \"Legends\" as this RFC implies.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \n   The web page at http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info still redirects to https://trustee.ietf.org/documents/trust-legal-provisions/, but that page was recently updated to point the reader to the IETF Trust FAQ for RFC5378 instructions.
