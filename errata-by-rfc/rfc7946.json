Transformations from WGS84 vertical coordinate values to EGM2008 coordinate values shall not be implemented (unless by prior arrangement between involved parties) .\r\n\r\nThere is specification information within the EPSG registry on both the EGM2008 vertical datum:\r\nhttps://epsg.org/crs_3855/EGM2008-height.html\r\nand on the compound of WGS84 latitude longitude with EGM2008 altitude\r\nhttps://epsg.org/crs_9518/WGS-84-EGM2008-height.html\r\n\r\nCommon usage of altitude vertical coordinates is with respect to mean sea level. However, the original text within rfc7946 state that a vertical coordinate is with respect to the WGS84 reference ellipsoid.  \r\n\r\nThe WGS84 reference ellipsoid is an oblate spheroid that only partially approximates mean sea level. The EGM2008 (superseding EGM96) vertical  datum provides\r\n\"Zero-height surface resulting from the application of the EGM2008 geoid model to the WGS 84 ellipsoid.\" (https://epsg.org/crs_3855/EGM2008-height.htm)\r\nEGM2008 closely models mean sea level as a global vertical datum.\r\n \r\nDistortions are global position dependent, discrepancies can range from less than a metre to 10s of metres.  For example, at a location of  (50.218 -5.327 (WGS84)) the discrepancy between a WGS84 vertical coordinate and a EGM2008 vertical coordinate is 53.4 metres.\r\nThis is a really significant vertical discrepancy for a positional coordinate.\r\n\r\nThe update within this errata matches the specification to the widespread and common use of vertical position with respect to mean sea level, as measured by national mapping agencies and satellite earth observations.",
