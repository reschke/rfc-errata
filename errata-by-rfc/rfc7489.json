    "notes": "The name \"PolicyPublishedType\" suggests that the elements within it represent the domain's published policy. But the comment from element \"fo\" describes itself as \"Failure reporting options IN EFFECT\".\r\n\r\nA lot of organizations do not send failure (forensic) reports and do not publish the \"fo\" element in their aggregate reports (Google, Yahoo!, Zoho) . This is reasonable since the description says \"in effect\". But the field also has a (default) MinOccurs of 1 because MinOccurs is not defined. So by omitting the element, the reports from these organizations are in violation of the guidelines.\r\n\r\nShould an aggregate report have a mandatory \"fo\" element, even if the organization doesn't do failure (forensic) reporting? If so, than the comment \"<!-- Failure reporting options in effect. -->\" should be \"<!-- Failure reporting options. -->\". And if not, than the minOccurs=\"0\" should be added to the \"fo\" element to allow it to be optional.\r\n\r\nEven if DMARC policy options are OPTIONAL and not specified, the messages are processed by the receiver with the default values. This is also the case for adkim and aspf, which also have a minOccurs of 0.\r\n\r\nSo i would suggest the following:\r\n\r\nThe PolicyPublishedType describe the policy that is applied tot the messages in the reports. Elements that are not defined by the domain's DMARC policy should be filled with the default values, as they would also be processed that way. So when adkim is not configured in the policy, the report should state value \"r\" as this is the default value. Same applies to aspf (\"r\"), sp (same as \"p\"), pct (100) and fo (0). Even if an organization doesn't send out failure reports it MUST mention the \"fo\" value from the domain's policy, or, when not specified, the default value of 0.",
