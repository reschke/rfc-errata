    "notes": "The original description of Integerify looks, to a programmer, as though a single byte (the final octet) is being converted to an integer (as with the Python `ord` operation). But that wouldn't make sense with the term \"little-endian\", which has meaning only with multiple-byte words. So the likely conclusion would be that this was a typographical error, and that the entire string X (or B) should be treated as an integer [e.g., Python3 int.from_bytes(b'\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff', 'little')]. However, this interpretation of Integerify gives results that do not match the test vectors.\r\n\r\nBy looking at other people's code (https://github.com/ricmoo/pyscrypt in particular) I found that using the 4 bytes beginning halfway through the octet string gives results which do match the test vectors.",

    "notes": "The wording in itself is a bit unclear, but the phrase \"but as memory latency and CPU parallelism increase\" might be interpreted as \"but as memory latency increase and CPU parallelism increase\", which in combination with the following phrase \"it is likely that the optimum values for both r and p will increase\" is inconsistent with how scrypt operates. All other things being equal (including but not limited to the parameters used and CPU or ASIC performance), the scrypt algorithm have an inverse-proportional relationship to memory latency, especially if the low-latency memory can contain all of the temporary computational data the algorithm needs.",
