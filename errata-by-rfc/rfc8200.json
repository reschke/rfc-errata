For example, a formula for\r\n         computing the Payload Length of the reassembled original packet\r\n         is:\r\n\r\n            PL.orig = PL.first - FL.first - 8 + (8 * FO.last) + FL.last\r\n\r\n\r\n            where\r\n            PL.orig  =  Payload Length field of reassembled packet.\r\n            PL.first =  Payload Length field of first fragment packet.\r\n            FL.first =  length of fragment following Fragment header of\r\n                        first fragment packet.\r\n            FO.last  =  Fragment Offset field of Fragment header of last\r\n                        fragment packet.\r\n            FL.last  =  length of fragment following Fragment header of\r\n                        last fragment packet.\r\n\r\n         The Fragmentable Part of the reassembled packet is constructed\r\n         from the fragments following the Fragment headers in each of\r\n         the fragment packets.  The length of each fragment is computed\r\n         by subtracting from the packet's Payload Length the length of\r\n         the headers between the IPv6 header and fragment itself; its\r\n         relative position in Fragmentable Part is computed from its\r\n         Fragment Offset value.\r\n\r\n         The Fragment header is not present in the final, reassembled\r\n         packet.\r\n\r\n         If the fragment is a whole datagram (that is, both the Fragment\r\n         Offset field and the M flag are zero), then it does not need\r\n         any further reassembly and should be processed as a fully\r\n         reassembled packet (i.e., updating Next Header, adjust Payload\r\n         Length, removing the Fragment header, etc.).  Any other\r\n         fragments that match this packet (i.e., the same IPv6 Source\r\n         Address, IPv6 Destination Address, and Fragment Identification)\r\n         should be processed independently.\r\n\r\n   The following error conditions may arise when reassembling fragmented\r\n   packets:\r\n\r\n      o  If insufficient fragments are received to complete reassembly\r\n         of a packet within 60 seconds of the reception of the first-\r\n         arriving fragment of that packet, reassembly of that packet\r\n         must be abandoned and all the fragments that have been received\r\n         for that packet must be discarded.  If the first fragment\r\n         (i.e., the one with a Fragment Offset of zero) has been\r\n         received, an ICMP Time Exceeded -- Fragment Reassembly Time\r\n         Exceeded message should be sent to the source of that fragment.\r\n\r\n      o  If the length of a fragment, as derived from the fragment\r\n         packet's Payload Length field, is not a multiple of 8 octets\r\n         and the M flag of that fragment is 1, then that fragment must\r\n         be discarded and an ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 0, message\r\n         should be sent to the source of the fragment, pointing to the\r\n         Payload Length field of the fragment packet.\r\n\r\n      o  If the length and offset of a fragment are such that the\r\n         Payload Length of the packet reassembled from that fragment\r\n         would exceed 65,535 octets, then that fragment must be\r\n         discarded and an ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 0, message should\r\n         be sent to the source of the fragment, pointing to the Fragment\r\n         Offset field of the fragment packet.\r\n\r\n      o  If the first fragment does not include all headers through an\r\n         Upper-Layer header, then that fragment should be discarded and\r\n         an ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 3, message should be sent to\r\n         the source of the fragment, with the Pointer field set to zero.\r\n\r\n      o  If any of the fragments being reassembled overlap with any\r\n         other fragments being reassembled for the same packet,\r\n         reassembly of that packet must be abandoned and all the\r\n         fragments that have been received for that packet must be\r\n         discarded, and no ICMP error messages should be sent.\r\n\r\n         It should be noted that fragments may be duplicated in the\r\n         network.  Instead of treating these exact duplicate fragments\r\n         as overlapping fragments, an implementation may choose to\r\n         detect this case and drop exact duplicate fragments while\r\n         keeping the other fragments belonging to the same packet.\r\n\r\n   The following conditions are not expected to occur frequently but are\r\n   not considered errors if they do:\r\n\r\n      The number and content of the headers preceding the Fragment\r\n      header of different fragments of the same original packet may\r\n      differ.  Whatever headers are present, preceding the Fragment\r\n      header in each fragment packet, are processed when the packets\r\n      arrive, prior to queueing the fragments for reassembly.  Only\r\n      those headers in the Offset zero fragment packet are retained in\r\n      the reassembled packet.\r\n\r\n      The Next Header values in the Fragment headers of different\r\n      fragments of the same original packet may differ.  Only the value\r\n      from the Offset zero fragment packet is used for reassembly.\r\n\r\n      Other fields in the IPv6 header may also vary across the fragments\r\n      being reassembled.  Specifications that use these fields may\r\n      provide additional instructions if the basic mechanism of using\r\n      the values from the Offset zero fragment is not sufficient.  For\r\n      example, Section 5.3 of [RFC3168] describes how to combine the\r\n      Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) bits from different\r\n      fragments to derive the ECN bits of the reassembled packet.\r\n      \r\n",

Examples of upper-layer headers include TCP, UDP,\r\n           IPv4, IPv6, ICMPv6, and as noted ESP.\r\n\r\n      (4)  The remainder of the first fragment.\r\n\r\n   The subsequent fragment packets are composed of:\r\n\r\n      (1)  The Per-Fragment headers of the original packet, with the\r\n           Payload Length of the original IPv6 header changed to contain\r\n           the length of this fragment packet only (excluding the length\r\n           of the IPv6 header itself), and the Next Header field of the\r\n           last header of the Per-Fragment headers changed to 44.\r\n\r\n      (2)  A Fragment header containing:\r\n\r\n              The Next Header value that identifies the first header\r\n              after the Per-Fragment headers of the original packet.\r\n\r\n              A Fragment Offset containing the offset of the fragment,\r\n              in 8-octet units, relative to the start of the\r\n              Fragmentable Part of the original packet.\r\n\r\n              An M flag value of 0 if the fragment is the last\r\n              (\"rightmost\") one, else an M flag value of 1.\r\n\r\n              The Identification value generated for the original\r\n              packet.\r\n\r\n      (3)  The fragment itself.\r\n\r\n   Fragments must not be created that overlap with any other fragments\r\n   created from the original packet.\r\n\r\n   At the destination, fragment packets are reassembled into their\r\n   original, unfragmented form, as illustrated:\r\n\r\n   reassembled original packet:\r\n\r\n   +------------------+----------------------//------------------------+\r\n   |  Per-Fragment    |                 Fragmentable                   |\r\n   |    Headers       |                     Part                       |\r\n   +------------------+----------------------//------------------------+\r\n\r\n   The following rules govern reassembly:\r\n\r\n      An original packet is reassembled only from fragment packets that\r\n      have the same Source Address, Destination Address, and Fragment\r\n      Identification.\r\n\r\n      The Per-Fragment headers of the reassembled packet consists of all\r\n      headers up to, but not including, the Fragment header of the first\r\n      fragment packet (that is, the packet whose Fragment Offset is\r\n      zero), with the following two changes:\r\n\r\n         The Next Header field of the last header of the Per-Fragment\r\n         headers is obtained from the Next Header field of the first\r\n         fragment's Fragment header.\r\n\r\n         The Payload Length of the reassembled packet is computed from\r\n         the length of the Per-Fragment headers and the length and\r\n         offset of the last fragment.  For example, a formula for\r\n         computing the Payload Length of the reassembled original packet\r\n         is:\r\n\r\n            PL.orig = PL.first - FL.first - 8 + (8 * FO.last) + FL.last\r\n\r\n\r\n            where\r\n            PL.orig  =  Payload Length field of reassembled packet.\r\n            PL.first =  Payload Length field of first fragment packet.\r\n            FL.first =  length of fragment following Fragment header of\r\n                        first fragment packet.\r\n            FO.last  =  Fragment Offset field of Fragment header of last\r\n                        fragment packet.\r\n            FL.last  =  length of fragment following Fragment header of\r\n                        last fragment packet.\r\n\r\n         The Fragmentable Part of the reassembled packet is constructed\r\n         from the fragments following the Fragment headers in each of\r\n         the fragment packets.  The length of each fragment is computed\r\n         by subtracting from the packet's Payload Length the length of\r\n         the headers between the IPv6 header and fragment itself; its\r\n         relative position in Fragmentable Part is computed from its\r\n         Fragment Offset value.\r\n\r\n         The Fragment header is not present in the final, reassembled\r\n         packet.\r\n\r\n         If the fragment is a whole datagram (that is, both the Fragment\r\n         Offset field and the M flag are zero), then it does not need\r\n         any further reassembly and should be processed as a fully\r\n         reassembled packet (i.e., updating Next Header, adjust Payload\r\n         Length, removing the Fragment header, etc.).  Any other\r\n         fragments that match this packet (i.e., the same IPv6 Source\r\n         Address, IPv6 Destination Address, and Fragment Identification)\r\n         should be processed independently.\r\n\r\n   The following error conditions may arise when reassembling fragmented\r\n   packets:\r\n\r\n      o  If insufficient fragments are received to complete reassembly\r\n         of a packet within 60 seconds of the reception of the first-\r\n         arriving fragment of that packet, reassembly of that packet\r\n         must be abandoned and all the fragments that have been received\r\n         for that packet must be discarded.  If the first fragment\r\n         (i.e., the one with a Fragment Offset of zero) has been\r\n         received, an ICMP Time Exceeded -- Fragment Reassembly Time\r\n         Exceeded message should be sent to the source of that fragment.\r\n\r\n      o  If the length of a fragment, as derived from the fragment\r\n         packet's Payload Length field, is not a multiple of 8 octets\r\n         and the M flag of that fragment is 1, then that fragment must\r\n         be discarded and an ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 0, message\r\n         should be sent to the source of the fragment, pointing to the\r\n         Payload Length field of the fragment packet.\r\n\r\n      o  If the length and offset of a fragment are such that the\r\n         Payload Length of the packet reassembled from that fragment\r\n         would exceed 65,535 octets, then that fragment must be\r\n         discarded and an ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 0, message should\r\n         be sent to the source of the fragment, pointing to the Fragment\r\n         Offset field of the fragment packet.\r\n\r\n      o  If the first fragment does not include all headers through an\r\n         Upper-Layer header, then that fragment should be discarded and\r\n         an ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 3, message should be sent to\r\n         the source of the fragment, with the Pointer field set to zero.\r\n\r\n      o  If any of the fragments being reassembled overlap with any\r\n         other fragments being reassembled for the same packet,\r\n         reassembly of that packet must be abandoned and all the\r\n         fragments that have been received for that packet must be\r\n         discarded, and no ICMP error messages should be sent.\r\n\r\n         It should be noted that fragments may be duplicated in the\r\n         network.  Instead of treating these exact duplicate fragments\r\n         as overlapping fragments, an implementation may choose to\r\n         detect this case and drop exact duplicate fragments while\r\n         keeping the other fragments belonging to the same packet.\r\n\r\n   The following conditions are not expected to occur frequently but are\r\n   not considered errors if they do:\r\n\r\n      The number and content of the headers preceding the Fragment\r\n      header of different fragments of the same original packet may\r\n      differ.  Whatever headers are present, preceding the Fragment\r\n      header in each fragment packet, are processed when the packets\r\n      arrive, prior to queueing the fragments for reassembly.  Only\r\n      those headers in the Offset zero fragment packet are retained in\r\n      the reassembled packet.\r\n\r\n      The Next Header values in the Fragment headers of different\r\n      fragments of the same original packet may differ.  Only the value\r\n      from the Offset zero fragment packet is used for reassembly.\r\n\r\n      Other fields in the IPv6 header may also vary across the fragments\r\n      being reassembled.  Specifications that use these fields may\r\n      provide additional instructions if the basic mechanism of using\r\n      the values from the Offset zero fragment is not sufficient.  For\r\n      example, Section 5.3 of [RFC3168] describes how to combine the\r\n      Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) bits from different\r\n      fragments to derive the ECN bits of the reassembled packet.\r\n",

    "notes": "This erratum addresses the following problems from RFC8200:\r\n\r\n* It clarifies that IPv6 does not support en-route insertion/removal\r\n  of IPv6 Extension Headers\r\n\r\n* Clarifies the the processing rules for Routing Headers and Destination\r\n  Options headers preceding a Routing Header.\r\n\r\n\r\nRATIONALE:\r\n\r\nIPv6 never supported the en-route insertion/removal of IPv6 Extension Headers, since it would have broken a number of IPv6 core components, including:\r\n\r\n* IPsec Authentication Header (AH)\r\n\r\n* Path-MTU Discovery for IPv6 (RFC8201)\r\n\r\n* Error reporting based on ICMPv6 error messages (RFC4443), since hosts\r\n  validate that received error messages correspond to packets sent by\r\n  the host receiving the error message.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the intent of RFC8200 to clarify this behavior, as noted by Appendix B (\"Changes Since RFC 2460\") of RFC8200:\r\n\r\n   o  Clarified that extension headers (except for the Hop-by-Hop\r\n      Options header) are not processed, inserted, or deleted by any\r\n      node along a packet's delivery path.\r\n\r\nhowever, the resulting text was far from perfect. This erratum means to more closely reflect and respect the intent of RFC8200.\r\n\r\nThe corrected text has benefited from the review and input from Ron Bonica, Brian Carpenter, and Tom Herbert.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nSection 3 clearly highlights for the reader when the IPv6 Destination Address in the header might differ from the IPv6 address of the ultimate destination.\r\n\r\nAs such, all references in the document to \"Destination Address\" lacking further qualifying text should be read bearing this in mind.  The text in section 4 is no exception.  The key text has remained unchanged since RFC 1883.\r\n\r\nThough it may be fraught with operational peril, including impeding the correct processing by the source node of a received ICMPv6 error message's encapsulated packet payload, a strict literal reading of the existing text affords any node in the header's Destination Address field a (possibly surprising) degree of flexibility in the handling of extension headers.\r\n\r\nIf IPsec AH (RFC 4302) were in use, the overall IPv6 header Payload Length field would need to remain intact, but the contents of certain types of extension headers between the IPv6 header and the AH header may not need to be preserved.  If AH is not in use, it is not clear that any AH-related requirements need apply at all.\r\n\r\nGiven the continuing discussion, whether this text (and its strict literal interpretation) is a feature or a bug appears to lack consensus.\r\n\r\nIn fact, considering the apparent lack of substantive progress toward resolution on this issue in the working group since https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5933 previously attempted to revise this text, continuing use of the erratum report process for this could risk the appearance of bypassing the working group consensus process.\r\n\r\nThe text from Section 3 makes it clear that making the kind of change proposed would require a consensus change; this is not a matter to be address by an erratum alone.\r\n",
