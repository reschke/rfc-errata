    "notes": "The changed word is indicated by asterisks. RFC 8179 provides clear definitions of the terms it uses, particularly the important term “Contribution”. In this case, Section 5.7 (Disclosures for Oral Contributions) is talking very specifically about a written “Contribution”, as defined in Section 1, not a “disclosure”. This interpretation of what this text was intending to say is supported by the (non-normative) change summary given in Section 13, which says, “However, if an oral contribution is made and it is not followed by a written contribution, then...” Note use of the term, “written contribution”, not “written disclosure”.",
