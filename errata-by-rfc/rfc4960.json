In\r\n   some situations, it may be beneficial for an SCTP transmitter to be\r\n   more conservative than the algorithms detailed in this document\r\n   allow.  However, an SCTP transmitter MUST NOT be more aggressive than\r\n   the following algorithms allow.\r\n\r\n   An SCTP receiver MUST NOT generate more than one SACK for every\r\n   incoming packet, other than to update the offered window as the\r\n   receiving application consumes new data.\r\n\r\n   IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: The maximum delay for generating an\r\n   acknowledgement may be configured by the SCTP administrator, either\r\n   statically or dynamically, in order to meet the specific timing\r\n   requirement of the protocol being carried.\r\n\r\n   An implementation MUST NOT allow the maximum delay (protocol \r\n   parameter 'SACK.Delay') to be configured to be more than 500 ms.\r\n   In other words, an implementation MAY lower the value of \r\n   'SACK.Delay' below 500 ms but MUST NOT raise it above 500 ms.\r\n\r\n[ remaining of the section unchanged ]\r\n\r\n***********************************************************************\r\n15.  Suggested SCTP Protocol Parameter Values\r\n\r\n   The following protocol parameters are RECOMMENDED:\r\n\r\n      RTO.Initial - 3 seconds\r\n      RTO.Min - 1 second\r\n      RTO.Max - 60 seconds\r\n      Max.Burst - 4\r\n      RTO.Alpha - 1/8\r\n      RTO.Beta - 1/4\r\n      Valid.Cookie.Life - 60 seconds\r\n      Association.Max.Retrans - 10 attempts\r\n      Path.Max.Retrans - 5 attempts (per destination address)\r\n      Max.Init.Retransmits - 8 attempts\r\n      HB.interval - 30 seconds\r\n      HB.Max.Burst - 1\r\n      SACK.Delay - 200 milliseconds\r\n\r\n   IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: The SCTP implementation may allow ULP to\r\n   customize some of these protocol parameters (see Section 10).\r\n\r\n   Note: RTO.Min SHOULD be set as recommended above.",
    "notes": "In section 6.2, the name 'SACK.Delay' is given to the protocol parameter that indicate themaximum delay for generating a SACK.\r\n\r\nIn section 15, the list of SCTP protocol parameters and associated recommended value is not complete.
