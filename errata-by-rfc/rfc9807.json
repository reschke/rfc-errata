The submitter correctly identifies that the notation is confusing: having a function call on the left side of an assignment looks backwards. The equation is mathematically correct (XOR with the same pad recovers the concatenated data), but clearer notation would compute the XOR first, then parse the result. A future revision could address this. However, the proposed correction (\"= unknown?\") does not provide actionable replacement text.",
