    "orig_text": "   This document removes discussion of the INTERNAL_ADDRESS_EXPIRY\r\n   configuration attribute because its implementation was very\r\n   problematic.  Implementations that conform to this document MUST\r\n   ignore proposals that have configuration attribute type 5, the old\r\n   value for INTERNAL_ADDRESS_EXPIRY \r\n",
    "correct_text": "Unclear what it should be",
    "notes": "Configuration attribute 5, INTERNAL_ADDRESS_EXPIRY, is a type of attribute in a configuration payload.  It is not an attribute in a proposal.  As documented in Section 2.7 proposals are part of an SA payload.\r\n\r\n   An SA payload consists of one or more proposals.  Each proposal\r\n   includes one protocol.  Each protocol contains one or more transforms\r\n   -- each specifying a cryptographic algorithm.  Each transform\r\n   contains zero or more attributes (attributes are needed only if the\r\n   Transform ID does not completely specify the cryptographic\r\n   algorithm).\r\n\r\nSo the correct behavior when one receives a *configuration* payload with INTERNAL_ADDRESS_EXPIRY cannot be to ignore a proposal.  Was the intent to say that the configuration payload should be ignored?  Was the intent to say that the configuration payload should be processed but the INTERNAL_ADDRESS_EXPIRY attribute ignored?  Clearly these choices would result in radically different outcomes for the negotiation.\r\n\r\nPaul Wouters:\r\n\r\nThis comment is about the use of the word \"proposal\" which I agree is open to wrong interpretation. My suggestion would be:\r\n\r\nCurrent:\r\n\r\n    Implementations that conform to this document MUST\r\n    ignore proposals that have configuration attribute type 5, the old\r\n    value for INTERNAL_ADDRESS_EXPIRY\r\n\r\nProposed:\r\n\r\n    Implementations that conform to this document MUST\r\n    process configuration attribute value 5 similar to\r\n    any other unknown Attribute Type.\r\n\r\nIt is mostly obvious that only the attribute type should be ignored, not the entire proposal. Therefor Held for Document update as it does not affect implementations but the wording should be improved in future versions of the document",
