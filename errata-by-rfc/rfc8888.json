    "notes": "The text can be read as the range being [begin_seq, begin_seq+num_reports].\r\n\r\nIf \"begin_seq\" is taken as the first sequence number you are reporting on, the original text means that you would have to have num_reports be 0 when you are reporting on a single packet. This seems very strange.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if \"begin_seq\" is taken as the sequence number before the one you are reporting on, the num_reports is consistent, but you are then reporting on the range <begin_seq, begin_seq+num_reports], which also seems strange.\r\n\r\nThe suggested clarification would report on the sequence [begin_seq, begin_seq + num_reports>, which seems like the most natural interpretation.\r\n\r\nThis is also consistent with the format of an empty report, which is explicit that begin_seq is the sequence number of the last RTP packet received.",
