    "notes": "The token response includes parameters, not claims.\r\n\r\nAlso, per Section 3.2 of RFC 9201, the rs_cnf parameter is \"OPTIONAL if the token type is \"pop\" and asymmetric keys are used\", while it \"MUST NOT be present otherwise.\" At the same time, the cnf parameter is \"REQUIRED if the token type is \"pop\" and a symmetric key is used.\"\r\n\r\nThe quoted paragraph from Section 3.3.2 of RFC 9202 refers to the PSK mode. Hence, per Section 3.2 of RFC 9201, the cnf parameter should be included in the token response from the authorization server (not the rs_cnf parameter).\r\n\r\nThis is also consistent with the last paragraph in the same Section 3.3.2.",
