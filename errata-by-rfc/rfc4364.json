The PE and CE routers may be BGP peers, and the CE router may\r\n         use BGP (in particular, EBGP to tell the PE router the set of\r\n         address prefixes that are at the CE router's site. (This\r\n         technique can be used in stub VPNs or transit VPNs.)\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n                                    vvv\r\n      4.

All that\r\n   is required is that the external routes be known to whatever routers\r\n   are responsible for putting the label stack on a hitherto unlabeled\r\n   packet and that there be label switched path that leads from those\r\n   routers to their BGP peers at other sites.
