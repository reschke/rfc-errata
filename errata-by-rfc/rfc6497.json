There is no restriction on subtag ordering in an extension imposed by BCP 47, but an extension can specify such an order (in this case it does). Subtags in this RFC are separated by DASH and the dash is not part of any subtag. Unlike the base language tag, there is interplay between subtags, but this is not the same thing as the submitter implies. There exist important implementations that depend on this.",
