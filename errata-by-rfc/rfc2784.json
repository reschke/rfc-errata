It further stated that \"[b]its 5 through 12 are reserved for future use and MUST be transmitted as zero.\"  The language in RFC 2784 Section 5.2 makes it clear that incompatibilities between an  RFC 1701 transmitter and an RFC 2784 receiver arise only when one or more of the the Routing Present, Key Present, Sequence Number Present, and Strict Source Route bits are set, i.e., when any of bits 1-4 are set.\r\n\r\nVerifier's note: This looks like it was the intent of the authors, but the reader should note also RFC2890 which restores the K and S bits.\r\n",
