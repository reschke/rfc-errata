When the FU payload is not the last\r\n      fragment of a fragmented NAL unit, the E bit MUST be set to 0.\r\n\r\n   P: 1 bit\r\n      When set to 1, the P bit indicates the last FU of the last VCL NAL\r\n      unit of a coded picture, i.e., the last byte of the FU payload is\r\n      also the last byte of the last VCL NAL unit of the coded picture.\r\n      When the FU payload is not the last fragment of the last VCL NAL\r\n      unit of a coded picture, the P bit MUST be set to 0.",
