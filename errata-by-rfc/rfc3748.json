Since EAP is media independent, the presence or\r\n   absence of lower layer security is not taken into account in the\r\n   processing of EAP messages.\r\n\r\n   To improve reliability, if a peer receives a lower layer success\r\n   indication as defined in Section 7.2, it MAY conclude that a Success\r\n   packet has been lost, and behave as if it had actually received a\r\n   Success packet.  This includes choosing to ignore the Success in some\r\n   circumstances as described in Section 4.2.\r\n\r\n   A discussion of some reliability and security issues with lower layer\r\n   indications in PPP, IEEE 802 wired networks, and IEEE 802.11 wireless\r\n   LANs can be found in the Security Considerations, Section 7.12.\r\n\r\n   After EAP authentication is complete, the peer will typically\r\n   transmit and receive data via the authenticator.  It is desirable to\r\n   provide assurance that the entities transmitting data are the same\r\n   ones that successfully completed EAP authentication.  To accomplish\r\n   this, it is necessary for the lower layer to provide per-packet\r\n   integrity, authentication and replay protection, and to bind these\r\n   per-packet services to the keys derived during EAP authentication.\r\n   Otherwise, it is possible for subsequent data traffic to be modified,\r\n   spoofed, or replayed.\r\n\r\n   Where keying material for the lower layer ciphersuite is itself\r\n   provided by EAP, ciphersuite negotiation and key activation are\r\n   controlled by the lower layer.  In PPP, ciphersuites are negotiated\r\n   within ECP so that it is not possible to use keys derived from EAP\r\n   authentication until the completion of ECP.  Therefore, an initial\r\n   EAP exchange cannot be protected by a PPP ciphersuite, although EAP\r\n   re-authentication can be protected.\r\n\r\n   In IEEE 802 media, initial key activation also typically occurs after\r\n   completion of EAP authentication.  Therefore an initial EAP exchange\r\n   typically cannot be protected by the lower layer ciphersuite,\r\n   although an EAP re-authentication or pre-authentication exchange can\r\n   be protected.",

    "notes": "2nd paragraph of section 3.4 of RFC3748 states:\r\n---------------------\r\n   To improve reliability, >>if a peer receives a lower layer success\r\n   indication as defined in Section 7.2<<, it MAY conclude that a Success\r\n   packet has been lost, and behave as if it had actually received a\r\n   Success packet.  This includes choosing to ignore the Success in some\r\n   circumstances as described in Section 4.2.\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nRFC3748 section 7.2 does not seem to state anything about lower layer indications. \r\n\r\nRFC3748 section 7.12 contains some text on the lower layer indications and also RFC3748 section 7.16 contains some text on lower layer indications.\r\n\r\nSo, it is proposed to change 2nd paragraph of section 3.4 of RFC3748 to reference section 7.12 (or section 7.16) instead of referencing section 7.2.",
