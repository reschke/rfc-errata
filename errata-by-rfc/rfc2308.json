A\r\n   server may be deemed to be dead or unreachable if it has not\r\n   responded to an outstanding query within 120 seconds.\r\n\r\n   Examples of transport layer indications are:\r\n\r\n      ICMP error messages indicating host, net or port unreachable.\r\n      TCP resets\r\n      IP stack error messages providing similar indications to those above.\r\n\r\n   A server MAY cache a dead server indication.  If it does so it MUST\r\n   NOT be deemed dead for longer than five (5) minutes.  The indication\r\n   MUST be stored against query tuple <query name, type, class, server\r\n   IP address> unless there was a transport layer indication that the\r\n   server does not exist, in which case it applies to all queries to\r\n   that specific IP address.",
