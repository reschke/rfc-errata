In addition Andy wrote:\r\n\r\n\"I am not sure this augment-when rule from RFC 7950 really applies here.\r\nThe augmenting leaf is in the same module, and all the objects were produced as a first release.\r\nThe added when-stmt is needed if the mandatory node is added in a new release of the same module\r\nor if it is defined in a separate module.\r\n\r\nIMO this should be held for document update for clarification.\"",
