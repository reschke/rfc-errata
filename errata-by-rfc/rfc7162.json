    "notes": "RFC 7162 purports to extend RFC 3501 by adding the HIGHESTMODSEQ value as an option for the resp-text-code syntax. However, RFC 3501 only uses resp-text-code in the resp-text ABNF production, in which case it is always followed by a single space (\"SP\") and the \"text\" non-terminal, which expands to \"1*TEXT-CHAR\", as in non-empty text. As such, having a response code without any human-readable text suffix is illegal per the RFC 3501 spec, and the examples should be updated to be correct.",
