    "notes": "In the original text, the phrase:\r\n\r\n\"(written as SN1/24 in the future)\"\r\n\r\nmay be misinterpreted. The intended meaning is that the notation SN1/24, referring to subnet SN1 with a 24-bit IP prefix, will be used throughout the remainder of the document for brevity. However, the wording could be ambiguously perceived as either (a) suggesting that this notation will be adopted in future revisions or drafts, or (b) implying a forward-looking change in nomenclature.",
