An attacker can generate an arbitrary query name in the\r\nform of \"$random.example.\" and simultaneously try to spoof a response. The\r\n\"$random\" label provides the attacker with an unlimited number of spoof\r\nattempts. A successful spoofing can include a DNAME RR with a QNAME's parent\r\nname. Such a spoofed RR can redirect the whole parent zone to a malicious\r\ntarget, or create a resolution loop.\r\n\r\nConsumers of DNS responses might consider the trustworthiness of DNAME RRs: Are\r\nthey DNSSEC-secure? Were they received via a non-spoofable transport (TCP, TLS,\r\nUDP with DNS cookies, etc.)? Depending on security posture, consumers might\r\nchoose to not use untrustworthy DNAME RRs, or choose to re-query using a secure\r\ntransport like TCP.\r\n",
