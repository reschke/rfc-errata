    "notes": "It is not generally incorrect that a value of Type-P-One-way-Delay can be obtained at each of the selected times. However, in that case it should also be mentioned in the following sentence (\"The value of the sample is the sequence made up of the resulting <time, loss> pairs\"), that the loss is 0 exactly when Type-P-One-way-Delay is a finite value, and it is 1 exactly when Type-P-One-way-Delay is undefined. But, as this observation is already made for the singleton metric Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss in section 2.5., it would be easier to directly refer to this singleton metric in section 3.4. (as suggested in this errata).",
