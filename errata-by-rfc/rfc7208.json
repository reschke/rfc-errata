    "notes": "Request for clarification: Are CNAME indirections allowed or, in other words, do they have to be followed during record lookup? If yes, do they count towards the DNS lookup limits as defined in section 4.6.4? If yes, the following sentence has to be adapted as well: \"SPF implementations MUST limit the total number of those terms to 10 during SPF evaluation, to avoid unreasonable load on the DNS.\" If the answer to the first question is no, then this should be made clear in section 4.4.\r\n\r\nPlease note that whether using CNAMEs is a good or bad idea is irrelevant to my question. I also know that you can't add a CNAME record to an apex domain but SPF is not limited to such domains. I assume the answer/consensus will be the same for the initial, `a`,  `include`, `exists` and `redirect` lookups. If not, this should also be clarified, of course.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \n   Errata reports are not the place to ask questions.  An appropriate mailing list on which to discuss SPF is the <ietf-smtp> list.",

These are sometimes collectively\r\nreferred to as \"void lookups\".  SPF implementations SHOULD limit\r\n\"void lookups\" to two.  An implementation MAY choose to make such a\r\nlimit configurable.

    "notes": "In addition to the above suggestion, I still see a contradiction between the \"void lookup limit\" and the \"exists\" mechanism. The functionality of \"exists\" includes (in my opinion) the negative response (RCODE 3). But the \"void lookup limit\" allows this to occur only twice. This limits the use of \"exists\" very much.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly: I have no good idea how to solve this. :-)",
