    "notes": "The above revision then complies with the other statements in the same paragraph:\r\n\r\n<quote>\r\nIn particular, it is important to avoid having the same source address bound to different binding anchors in different FCFS SAVI devices. Should that occur, then it would mean that two hosts are allowed to send packets with the same source address, which is what FCFS SAVI is trying to prevent.  In order to preserve the coherency of the FCFS SAVI bindings distributed among the FCFS SAVI devices within a realm, the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol [RFC4861] is used, in particular the Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages.\r\n</quote>\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nThe proposed change is incorrect.   I think you have misunderstood what the word \"coherent\" means, and this led to confusion.",
