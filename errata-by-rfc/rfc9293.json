    "notes": "Rationale / Implementability:\r\nItem (1) currently requires choosing an ISN “larger than the largest sequence number used on the previous connection incarnation.” On widely deployed systems (e.g., Linux), TCP does not maintain a per-connection persistent record of the “largest sequence number used” from the prior incarnation in a way that can be reliably applied to a subsequent connection reopened from TIME-WAIT. In practice, it may happen for a newly established connection to use an ISN that is smaller than the largest sequence number observed on a previous incarnation of the same 4-tuple, especially under rapid reconnect / port reuse and high-rate workloads.\r\n\r\nInteroperability:\r\nMany middleboxes (firewalls/load balancers/NAT devices) enforce sequence/window validity based on their own view of the prior flow and may drop segments they consider out-of-window or anomalous during/after fast reuse. This makes reopening directly from TIME-WAIT without a robust anti-duplicate mechanism prone to interoperability failures.\r\n\r\nProposed fix:\r\nReplace the “largest sequence number” requirement with an explicit requirement to use the Timestamp-based Best Current Practice described in [40] (RFC 6191) when reopening directly from TIME-WAIT. If TCP Timestamps are not available, the endpoint MUST NOT reopen directly from TIME-WAIT and should follow the normal TIME-WAIT behavior (2xMSL).",
