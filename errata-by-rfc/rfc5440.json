    "notes": "RFC 5440 is not consistent regarding the use of RFC2119 keywords. In section 5 the RFC states \"MUST\" regarding the registered port and in section 10.7.1 it is stated \"SHOULD\". Section 10.7.1 seems to imply the PCE could listen at any port (which is technically possible, but not in line with the rest of the document). Finally, the restriction about multiple connections is confusing: Section 4.2.1 \"Only one PCEP session can exist between a pair of PCEP peers at any one time\" but section 10.7.1 uses \"SHOULD NOT\". Technically, without the TCP source restriction, it should be possible to accept multiple connections from a PCEP peer, but such a change could have broader implications",
