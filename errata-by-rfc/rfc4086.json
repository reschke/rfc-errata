    "notes": "Compression is not suitable for de-skewing, even if headers are removed. For most compression algorithms, discriminators are known. For instance, in gzip output, the most significant bit of each byte is set with a frequency somewhat above 0.501 (except for small inputs). This means that the output is not uniformly distributed even when looking at isolated bytes.\r\n\r\nI recommend removal of the entire section.\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nI agree with the author:\r\n\r\nJust to be crystal clear, I believe there is no \"error\" here. Just a\r\njudgement call as to whether Section 4.4 should have been included. My\r\njudgement that it should be included was ratified by the IETF at the\r\ntime the RFC was approved.",
