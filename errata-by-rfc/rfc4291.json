According to this prefix, the entire range of link-local addresses covers all addresses within the range of FE80:: through FEBF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF.\r\n\r\nThe format of link-local addresses as stated in Section 2.5.6 seems to partially contradict Section 2.4 in that it fixes the internal 54 bits between the 10-bit prefix and the IID to the value of 0. If that was the case then the prefix of link-local addresses would have been in fact FE80::/64 instead of FE80::/10, and the range of link-local addresses would have been limited to FE80:: through FE80::FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF. Thus, the definition of link-local addresses as follows from Section 2.4 does not align with the definition of link-local addresses as presented in Section 2.5.6.\r\n\r\nI suggest resolving this internal contradiction by explicitly stating in Section 2.5.6 that the internal 54 bits of a link-local address that follow the FE80::/10 prefix can be of an arbitrary value.\r\n\r\nThank you!\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \n   Section 2.4 reserves the FE80::/10 prefix for use on the local link.

    "notes": "Text in several sections of 4291 seem to be logically inconsistent with respect to Link-Local unicast addresses. The inconsistency spans Sections 2.1, 2.5 and 2.5.6.\r\n\r\nSection 2.5 says that unicast addresses, including Link-Local unicast addresses, on links a host is attached to have the following internal structure, providing a definition for \"subnet prefix\":\r\n\r\n   |          n bits               |           128-n bits            |\r\n   +-------------------------------+---------------------------------+\r\n   |       subnet prefix           |           interface ID          |\r\n   +-------------------------------+---------------------------------+\r\n\r\nSection 2.5.6 specifies that Link-Local unicast addresses have the following format:\r\n\r\n   |   10     |\r\n   |  bits    |         54 bits         |          64 bits           |\r\n   +----------+-------------------------+----------------------------+\r\n   |1111111010|           0             |       interface ID         |\r\n   +----------+-------------------------+----------------------------+\r\n\r\nApplying the Section 2.5 definition, Link-Local unicast addresses hence have a subnet prefix of fe80::/64 on every link.\r\n\r\nSection 2.1 says this about the addressing model:\r\n\r\n   Currently, IPv6 continues the IPv4 model in that a subnet prefix is\r\n   associated with one link.\r\n\r\nClearly the use of a same Link-Local unicast subnet prefix on every link is inconsistent with an addressing model that requires a subnet prefix to be unique to one link. The plain reading of this text is that it disagrees with itself, so either something needs to change to bring it into agreement or some explanation of how this is in fact consistent needs to be made. Since I don't know what the intent of this was I don't really know what needs fixing.\r\n\r\nThe proposed text hence reflects my personal biases; while I understand subnet prefix uniqueness to be foundational to the forwarding behaviour of Global Unicasts I have no idea what a \"subnet prefix\" even means in the context of Link-Local unicasts. The proposed text hence modifies Section 2.5 to exclude Link-Local addresses from the part of that section defining a \"subnet prefix\" and instead be defines them to provide a flat address space that is reused on every link. That is, Link-Local addresses are defined without a subnet prefix.\r\n\r\nThis leaves the Section 2.1 statement about subnet prefixes, and the forwarding behaviour implied by that, applicable to Global Unicast addresses but inapplicable to Link-Local addresses. Given this Section 2.5.6 can be read to be solely a constraint on Link-Local address construction, i.e. requiring SLAAC and other methods of Link-Local configuration to only produce addresses from that subset, without any implication for forwarding behaviour that \"subnet prefix\" might suggest.\r\n\r\nThat this general topic seems to produce periodic flurries of concern might be an indication that greater clarity in specification here might be useful.",

    "notes": "1. The existing wording would permit \"::\" to be used in leading or trailing position to compress a single 16-bit piece, leading to the conclusion that \"::0:0:0:0:0:0:1\" is a valid way to write the loopback address, with eight colons.\r\n\r\nMany consumers of textual IPv6 addresses would reject this out of hand as \"too many colons\", and it seems questionable that such an interpretation was ever intended. Enforcing this on producers would improve interoperability.\r\n\r\n2. The preceding paragraphs defines \"piece\", but the undefined term \"group\" is used in this paragraph, so by changing that term I hope to clarify that this is a textual substitution, necessarily aligned to a multiple of 16 bits.\r\n\r\nI am uncomfortable with the phrasing \"pieces of 16 bits of zeros\", but I offer it as a single-word change to effect my point (2); I leave it to the discretion of the editor which of my alternatives to adopt.",
