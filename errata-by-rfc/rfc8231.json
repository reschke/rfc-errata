Adrian ends his rejection comment with \r\n\r\n“In rejecting this Errata report I note that the reported error is not a typo,\r\nbut a deliberate decision of the authors and working group. The fix, therefore,\r\nif it is to be applied needs to be achieved through a consensus document.”\r\n\r\nAFAICT this reasoning applies equally in the current case. Actually, it applies even more so, because the WG was offered draft-cmfg-pce-pcep-grammar-02 and didn’t do anything with it, which implies no consensus was demonstrated to go forward with a solution to the identified problem. \r\n\r\nTherefore, I'm also rejecting this erratum. The right way forward is for the WG to take on this problem.",
