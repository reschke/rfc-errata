    "notes": "It is one of the benefits of 'Create' timestamps for directory\r\nentries that there is *no* enforced relationship between that\r\ntimestamp and the 'Modify' timestamp related to the file *content*.\r\n\r\nWe still support legacy systems from Hewlett-Packard that indeed\r\nmaintain three timestamps per directory entry: 'Create', 'Modify',\r\nand 'Access'.  The very useful behaviour of the File System and\r\nthe proprietary Networking Services is as follows: If you move a\r\nfile to another directory or copy it (within a system, or across\r\nthe network), the 'Modify' timestamp does not change (since the\r\nfile content is unchanged from what it was then), only the 'Create'\r\ntimestamp of the new directory entry is set to the current time.\r\n(This means the 'Modify' timestamp behaves like a 'last update'\r\ntimestamp embedded in the file content, e.g., in a PDF file.)\r\nIn this case, the create fact would have to be *later* than the\r\nmodify fact, for RFC 3659.  Naturally, if a file was being edited,\r\nthe 'Modify' timestamp changes and will then be later than the\r\n'Create' timestamp.\r\nThe natural behaviour of a hypothetical FTP client implementing\r\nRFC 3659 in such environment, when performing a 'get' operation,\r\nwould be to obtain the modify timestamp of the remote file via\r\nMLSx or MDTM and, after performing the RETR (and, perhaps verifying\r\nthe 'atomicity' of the transfer via another MDTM that should deliver\r\nthe same response again) setting the 'Modify' timestamp of the local\r\ncopy of the file to the moment corresponding to the MDTM result\r\nvalue (or the modify fact value from the MLSx).\n --VERIFIER NOTES-- \nThis is a technical change that may be against the consensus of a WG and therefore is not appropriate for an erratum.",

    "notes": "The sample sequence in chapter 7.7.4 uses an example which is completely wrong, because it violates the basic BNF rules of its own document.\r\n\r\nPlease, see the definition, which is violated:\r\n\r\n7.2.  Format of MLSx Response\r\nThe format of a response to an MLSx command is as follows:\r\n      ...\r\n      entry            = [ facts ] SP pathname\r\n      facts            = 1*( fact \";\" )\r\n      fact             = factname \"=\" value\r\n      ...\r\n\r\nRemember, a fact may not contain \";\" or SPC (\" \")!\r\nNow take a look into the bad example:\r\n\r\n\r\n7.7.4.  A More Complex Example\r\n ...\r\n\tC> MLSD test\r\n\tS> 150 BINARY connection open for MLSD test\r\n\tD> Type=cdir;Perm=el;Unique=keVO1+ZF4; test\r\n\tD> Type=pdir;Perm=e;Unique=keVO1+d?3; ..\r\n\tD> Type=OS.unix=slink:/foobar;Perm=;Unique=keVO1+4G4; foobar\r\n\r\n\r\nthe last line uses the fact \"Type=OS.unix=slink:/foobar;\". While this line in special not violates the rules at the moment, it implies that \"Type=OS.unix=slink:\" starts printing the original link target of any given symbolic link. Not wrong till here, but in case a link points to an original directory which name contains a \";\" or, most worse, a \"; \" sequence, it will \r\nlead any client side PI into misinterpretation of the line.\r\n\r\nEven more worse, some actual public servers already use this bad syntax. Some can be found at least in the Swiss. It looks like they are running proftpd under Linux operating system, but this is unconfirmed for now.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nThe chapter 7 of the same document allows another approach to tell the client about the original destination of a symlink. This solution uses two lines of answer, see my example:\r\n\r\n\tC> MLSD test\r\n\tS> 150 BINARY connection open for MLSD test\r\n\tD> Type=cdir;Perm=el;Unique=keVO1+ZF4; test\r\n\tD> Type=pdir;Perm=e;Unique=keVO1+d?3; ..\r\n\tD> Type=OS.unix=symlink;Perm=;Unique=keVO1+4G4; foobar points somewhere else\r\n     ... more lines ...\r\n\tD> Type=dir;Perm=;Unique=keVO1+4G4; /foobar; does originally point to here\r\n\r\nbecause of the \"Unique\" fact, a client PI can now collect all lines with the fact \"Type=OS.unix=symlink\" and file it under an associative array (map, hastable) with \"keVO1+4G4\" as the access key. Once the client side parser again gets \"Unique=keVO1+4G4\", it now can record \"/foobar; does point to here\" as the original point where foobar points to.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly, what chapter 7.5.1.5 defines about the \"Unique\" fact. Please read:\r\n   Note: Where the underlying system supports a file type that is\r\n   essentially an indirect pointer to another file, the NVFS\r\n   representation of that type should normally be to represent the file\r\n   that the reference indicates.  That is, the underlying basic file\r\n   will appear more than once in the NVFS, each time with the \"unique\"\r\n   fact (see immediately following section) containing the same value,\r\n   indicating that the same file is represented by all such names.\r\n\r\n\r\nUseful to say, setting the slink into double quotes like suggested by some developers:\r\n\r\n\tD> Type=OS.unix=\"slink:/foobar\";Perm=;Unique=keVO1+4G4; foobar\r\n\r\nwould violate the same documents BNF rules (see RCHAR), as well it would require escaping of any DQUOTE in the link pathname itself. This, again, would violate RFC959 which not defines escaping of characters.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, FTP does not support 2 pathnames at the same line at all. This convention sould never been broken.",
