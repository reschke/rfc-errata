(If we choose\r\n   to allow carriage of fragments on transport mode SAs for IPv6, the\r\n|  problem arises in that context as well.)\r\n\r\n\r\n(6)  Insufficient IPcomp integration\r\n\r\nAt the end of section 3.1, on page 10, RFC 4301 says:\r\n\r\n   IPsec optionally supports negotiation of IP compression [SMPT01],\r\n   motivated in part by the observation that when encryption is employed\r\n   within IPsec, it prevents effective compression by lower protocol\r\n   layers.\r\n\r\nIt has also been observed that payload compression can help counter\r\nTPA.  Thus, there are at least two reasons for a tight integration\r\nof IPComp with IPsec.\r\nBut I could not find any 'hook' in RFC 4301 (and in RFC 4302 / 4303\r\nas well) for the concrete support of IPComp in ESP / AH IPsec SAs.\r\n\r\nIKEv2 (RFC 4306) roughly allows negotiation of IPComp, but how shall\r\nthat be triggered and work, in an interoperable way, if there are no\r\narchitectural provisions for the support of IPComp designed in into\r\nthe IPsec databases (SPD, SAD) as described in RFC 4301 ????\r\n\r\n\r\n(7)  Insufficient integration with QoS (DS)\r\n\r\nThe steps taken for the integration with Differentiated Services\r\nare half-hearted.  The processing rules specified for the DSCP\r\nfield in the IP header[s] remain incomplete as long as there is\r\nno specified interoperable way to use DSCP as an selector as well.\r\n\r\nIMHO, the discussion on page 14 of RFC 4301 is misleading because\r\nDS classification and treatment needs to be done independent from\r\nIPsec treatment.\r\nIn many scenarios, e.g. on 'hosts' or 'QoS gateways' that must\r\nperform fine-grained traffic classification, DS treatment must\r\nbe performed strictly before IPsec treatment in the outbound\r\ncase (and after IPsec in the inbound case), to make ULP fields\r\naccessible to the DS classifiers.\r\nIPsec should then be capable of guaranteeing the same security\r\ntreatment of all packets of certain traffic class to a given\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nI still have problems to imagine how DS integration could be\r\nachieved with the processing model of section 5.1 of RFC 4301.\r\n\r\nAt the end of section 3.1, on page 10, RFC 4301 says:\r\n\r\n\r\n(8)  Inconsistent DS Field handling specified in Section 5.1.2.x\r\n\r\nThe IPv6 related table in section 5.1.2.2 contains the line,\r\n\r\n        DS Field         copied from inner hdr (5)    no change (9)\r\n\r\nand the subsequent Notes give a lengthy explanation under (9).\r\n\r\nContrary to that, the corresponding table line for IPv4, in section\r\n5.1.2.1 on page 57, is *not* linked to such a note.\r\n\r\nI cannot see any reason precluding the application of the arguments\r\ngiven in Note (9) of section 5.1.2.2 to the IPv4 case as well.\r\n\r\nHave I missed any significant point there?\r\n\r\n\r\n(9)  SA negotiation -- capability mismatch with IKEv2\r\n\r\nSee section 4.4.1.2, second paragraph.",

Such a mode is essentially directly analogous to what AH provides, and thus this statement supports the downgrading of AH support to only a MAY-level requirement.",
